# Pipelines

## Overview of the Kubeflow pipelines service

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) is a machine learning (ML) toolkit that is dedicated to making deployments of ML workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable.

**Kubeflow pipelines** are reusable end-to-end ML workflows built using the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK.

The Kubeflow pipelines service has the following goals:

* End to end orchestration: enabling and simplifying the orchestration of end to end machine learning pipelines
* Easy experimentation: making it easy for you to try numerous ideas and techniques, and manage your various trials/experiments.
* Easy re-use: enabling you to re-use components and pipelines to quickly cobble together end to end solutions, without having to re-build each time.

Enables data scientists to define data pipelines (DAG) using notebook and python. We support only Multi-User isolation.

This component uses [argo](../argo-workflows) as the driver for pipelines.

## Dependency

Depends on:

* [`argo`](../argo-workflows): (Runtime for DAG). Argo dependency is transitive (via CRD)
* [`minio`](../minio): (DAG artifacts)
* [`mysql-pipelines`](../mysql): persistence
* [`kubeflow-profiles`](../kubeflow-profiles): (backend for multi-user isolation)
* [`kubeflow-metadata`](../kubeflow-metadata): (model outputs)

This component uses Kustomize extension and follows common design guidelines for Kustomize components.

## Changelog and TODOs

### Since Kubeflow v1.2

* [x] Introduced since kubeflow v1.2

> NOTE: this component has been subject of heavy changes since Kubeflow v1.3 upgrade might not be backward compatible (on infrastructure as code level)
